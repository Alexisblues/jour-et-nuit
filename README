Jour Et Nuit: Day 'n' Nite.

This software aims to be a functional replacement for the Xiaomi software for talking to the Xiaomi Mi Band called "Mi Fit"

The goals of this software are to:

* Provide a functional stand-in for the software without the need to create an account with Xiaomi
* Offer more granular information density than is offered by the Xiaomi software
* Export data (instead of holding it hostage)

How I've done this
------------------

This software is the result of reading over a lot of HCI snoop logs and reverse engineering of the obfuscated application.

The document "protocol.txt" is my knowledge of the protocol as it stands from multiple sources across the internet.
